Our fork of the [Jackal](https://clenemt.github.io/jackal/) theme.

- Github for the theme: https://clenemt.github.io/jackal/
- Demo of the theme: https://clenemt.github.io/jackal/
- Creator: http://clenemt.com

To run this locally:
- clone this repo
- run `bundle install` (you need ruby 2.1+ I _think_)
- run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to view the website at localhost:4000

Alternatively, you can run locally using [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/). Simply run: `nix-shell` to serve the site at localhost:4000. If the dependencies have been updated, it may be necessary to run `nix-shell -p bundix --run 'bundix'` to update gemset.nix.

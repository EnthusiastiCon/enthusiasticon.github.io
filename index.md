EnthusiastiCon is a conference for the programming community.
We will talk about what excites us the most about programming — the strange, the wonderful, and the clever solutions to unusual problems — on a day full of short presentations.

We're hoping that wonderful people will join us to share their enthusiasm with us or listen to what makes fellow programmers beam with joy about our craft.

## The plan

EnthusiastiCon will be held on **May 25 and May 26, 2019** in Berlin.
Saturday will be a day full of talks at ThoughtWorks.
For Sunday we're at an open space for sharing and collaboration with Co.up.
Find more information on the venues [here](/venue).

## Who Can Attend

This conference is open to everyone! Attendance will be free.
Please register before coming to the event, but only if you're actually coming.
If you're arriving without registration we might not be able to let you in for reasons of space.
We have **two independent registrations**, one for each day.

EnthusiastiCon is a conference for the programming community.
We will talk about what excites us the most about programming — the strange, the wonderful, and the clever solutions to unusual problems — over a weekend.

We're hoping that wonderful people will join us to share their enthusiasm with us or listen to what makes fellow programmers beam with joy about our craft.


## The Plan

EnthusiastiCon will be held on <b>June 6th &amp; 7th, 2020</b> at Wooga in Berlin.
Saturday will be a day full of talks and Sunday will be workshops and space for collaboration.


## Who Can Attend

This conference is open to everyone! Attendance will be free.

Registration will be open closer to the event.

## Our Sponsors for 2020

**CfP deadline extended to March 5th**

EnthusiastiCon is a conference for the programming community.
We will talk about what excites us the most about programming — the strange, the wonderful, and the clever solutions to unusual problems — on a day full of short presentations.

We're hoping that wonderful people will join us to share their enthusiasm with us or listen to what makes fellow programmers beam with joy about our craft.

## The plan

EnthusiastiCon will be held on **March 31 and April 1, 2018** in Berlin.
Saturday will be a day full of talks.
For Sunday we're discussing an open space for sharing and collaboration.

## Who Can Attend

This conference is open to everyone!
We would be delighted to receive a [talk proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}/cfp) from you.
We have room for up to 100 people at the venue and attendance will be free, though we may charge a no-show fee.

We extended the Call for Proposals. You can still hand in your talk idea by Monday!

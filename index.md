EnthusiastiCon is a conference for the programming community.
We will talk about what excites us the most about programming â€” the strange, the wonderful, and the clever solutions to unusual problems.

We're hoping that wonderful people will join us to share their enthusiasm or listen to what makes fellow programmers beam with joy about our craft.

Please note: the 2020 CfP is now closed.

## The Plan

EnthusiastiCon will be held **remotely** on <b>June 6th 2020</b> for a day of 10 minute talks.
We'll publish the schedule and details on how everything will work remotely closer to the time.


## Accessibility

EnthusiastiCon will have live captioning.

YouTube will be used for streaming talks and Zulip for attendees and speakers to connect and ask questions.
We'll provide more details about how this will work closer to the time.

There will be a break within each hour and a longer break in the middle.
The event will be about 6 hours altogether.

If you'd like to attend and need other accomodations please e-mail us at [info@enthusiasticon.de](mailto:info@enthusiasticon.de).

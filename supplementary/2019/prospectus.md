# EnthusiastiCon Prospectus

EnthusiastiCon is a free two day event in Berlin around enthusiasm for computing.
2019 will be its third edition.
The first day features short 10 minute talks followed by a second day of participant led workshops.
We aim for diversity in our speakers and their material while also aiming for a broad audience by proactively reaching-out.
We hope to open up conference speaking to people who'd otherwise be hesitant because of background or the material they want to present.
Our only criteria are that the material is about computing and enthusiasm!

## Last Year

- How many attendees

In 2018 we were humbled by the quality and refreshing variety of our talks.
What's more is that we were able to make EnthusiastiCon free to attend which we believe is key to making it accessible and inclusive.
We were able to do this because of the support we recieved from sponsors.

* We had more than double the number of talks proposed than slots.
* 60 attendees on the first day of talks.
* 30 attendees on the second day of participant-led workshops.
* Many were first time speakers.

## Our Team

The 2019 organising team is Nasreen Abu-Hunaina, Veit Heller, Moritz Need, Jens Ohlig, Joseph Yiasemides.
Inspired by !!Con in NYC and its other derivative conferences we liked the idea of holding a similar event in Europe.
One of our organisers wrote a blog post in 2018 with some context surrounding the conference: https://blog.veitheller.de/Enthusiasticon.html

Our call for proposals is now open!  To submit a proposal please fill out [this form](https://pretalx.enthusiasticon.de/enthusiasticon-2020/cfp).

**The deadline for applications is the 19th April 2020**.

We want to hear about what you are enthusiastic about in the computing world - whether it's a project you are having fun with, a fascinating bug you solved or the story of how you learned something special.  Whether you want to talk about hardware or software, and regardless of your background or profession.

We want to encourage you to submit a talk:
* if you are a first time speaker.
* if you are part of an underrepresented group in technology.
* if you hesitated submitting to other conferences, because you have the feeling that you are less qualified or that you have nothing to contribute.

All talks will be ten minutes long; this amount of time is easy to underestimate, or indeed overestimate.  This is why we ask for a proposed **timeline**.


## Resources

* If you would like to submit a proposal, but still need to come up with a topic, consider [this guide](https://www.deconstructconf.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-talk-topic).
It considers full length talks but might still be a source of inspiration.
* The folk from StarCon have prepared an [example proposal](https://starcon.io/cfp/#abstract) to illustrate what an abstract and timeline could look like.
* Lindsey Kuper has written about [how to write a timeline](http://composition.al/blog/2017/06/30/how-to-write-a-timeline-for-a-bangbangcon-talk-proposal/).


## Our selection process

When reviewing and selecting talks we would like to avoid biases and keep the process as fair as possible.

Your proposal will go through the following stages:
1. **Anonymization** We will have a coordinator who will anonymize the proposals.  The proposal reviewers will not be involved in this process.
2. **Review** The proposal reviewers will review and grade each proposal independently.  The coordinator will aggregate these grades, and the reviewers will discuss and agree on the talks to be accepted.  
3. **De-anonymization** Only the accepted proposals will be de-anonymized.


## Recording and Licensing

Should your talk be accepted, we would like to record (audio/video) and publish your talk on the internet for free under a [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

We will ask for you consent to film when you submit your proposal, this will not be seen by the review group when they make their decision.  You can change change your mind about this after your talk is accepted.

We ask that you make any materials used available under a CC BY-SA creative commons license.  You will retain full ownership of any materials used in your talk (slide deck, handouts etc).


## FAQ

**Should I remove identifying information from my abstract/ timeline?**

No - write the abstract as you would like it to appear if your talk is selected.  Our CfP coordinator will anonymize your application before the review group see it.

**Can I submit more than one talk?**

Yes, but please don’t submit more than two.
If both your talks are accepted, we will ask that you pick one.

**Can I get feedback on my application?**

Unfortunately, we will not be able to offer this.
We simply don’t have the resources to offer this to everyone at a quality we feel is appropriate.

**I have other questions! Who do I talk to?**

Please [email us](mailto:info@enthusiasticon.de) with any other questions!

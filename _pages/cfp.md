Our call for proposals is now open!  To submit a proposal please fill out [this form](https://pretalx.enthusiasticon.de/enthusiasticon-2020/cfp).

**The deadline for applications is the 30th April 2020**.

We want to hear about what you are enthusiastic about in the computing world - whether it's a project you are having fun with, a fascinating bug you solved or the story of how you learned something special.  Whether you want to talk about hardware or software, and regardless of your background or profession.

We especially encourage you to submit a talk if:
* you are a first time speaker.
* you are part of an underrepresented group in technology.
* you hesitated submitting to other conferences, because you have the feeling that you are less qualified or that you have nothing to contribute.

All talks will be 10 minutes long; this amount of time is easy to underestimate, or indeed overestimate.  This is why we ask for a proposed **timeline**.


## Resources

* If you would like to submit a proposal, but still need to come up with a topic, consider [this guide](https://www.deconstructconf.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-talk-topic).
It considers full length talks but might still be a source of inspiration.
* The folk from StarCon have prepared an [example proposal](https://starcon.io/cfp/#abstract) to illustrate what an abstract and timeline could look like.
* Lindsey Kuper has written [a great guide to writing a timeline](http://composition.al/blog/2017/06/30/how-to-write-a-timeline-for-a-bangbangcon-talk-proposal/).


## Our selection process

When reviewing and selecting talks we would like to avoid biases and keep the process as fair as possible.

Your proposal will go through the following stages:
1. **Anonymization** We will have a coordinator who will anonymize the proposals.  The proposal reviewers will not be involved in this process.
2. **Review** The proposal reviewers will review and grade each proposal independently.  The coordinator will aggregate these grades, and the reviewers will discuss and agree on the talks to be accepted.  
3. **De-anonymization** Only the accepted proposals will be de-anonymized.


## Recording and Licensing

Should your talk be accepted, we would like to record (audio/video) and publish your talk online under a [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

We will ask for your consent to film when you submit your proposal.  This will not be seen by the reviewers when making their decision and you can change your mind after your talk is accepted.  Before we publish the recordings, we will share yours with you and ask for your consent to publish.

We ask that you make any materials used available under a CC BY-SA creative commons license.  You will retain full ownership of any materials used in your talk (slide deck, handouts etc).


## FAQ

**When will I hear back?**

We'll get back to you by May 6th.

**What if my talk doesn't get accepted?**

Fear not!
To thank you for submitting a talk, you will be granted access to early registration.

**Should I remove identifying information from my abstract/ timeline?**

No - write the abstract as you would like it to appear if your talk is selected.  Our CfP coordinator will anonymize your application before the review group see it.

**Can I submit more than one talk?**

Yes, but please donâ€™t submit more than two.  If both your talks are accepted, we will ask that you pick one.

**Can I get feedback on my application?**

We can not promise this, as it depends on the volume of the submissions and the time we have, but our goal is to share constructive feedback with you in case your talk was not accepted. After all EnthusiastiCon is about learning cool new things, and submitting to a conference is definitive among those.

**I have other questions! Who do I talk to?**

If you have any concerns to share with our CfP coordinator, you can reach them at [cfp2020@enthusiasticon.de](mailto:cfp2020@enthusiasticon.de). The CfP coordinator is the person who will do the de-anonymization (see [Our Selection Process](#our-selection-process)), which means that you can discuss content questions with them in confidence.

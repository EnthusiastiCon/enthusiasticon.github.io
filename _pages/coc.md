# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees feel safe and welcome.

All attendees, speakers, organizers and volunteers at Enthusiasticon are required to observe the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

-----------------

Enthusiasticon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or anything else. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Please avoid making assumptions about people's pronouns. If you don't know what pronoun someone uses you can ask them or look at their name tag, where you may find their name and pronoun.  Otherwise please use their name rather than making an assumption about which pronoun to use.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Enthusiastion.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

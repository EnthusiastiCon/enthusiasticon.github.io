# Code of Conduct

EnthusiastiCon is organized under the [Friendly space policy for Wikimedia events](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Friendly_space_policy).
Please read it with care.

We want to make sure that everyone feels safe and welcome.
At the same time it's the first-time organizing a conference for most of us.
Thus, to make sure we're well prepared and set up when it comes to the conference, we are currently reaching out and consulting those with experience.
If you are planning to attend and interested in supporting us with your experience, please [get in touch](mailto:info@enthusiasticon.de).

More information on this and how we are planning to apply the policy will follow as soon as we have defined it.

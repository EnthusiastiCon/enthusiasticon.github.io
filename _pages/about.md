## Who is who stories

EnthusiastiCon [happened twice before](https://sourcecode.berlin/enthusiasticon/) in 2015 and 2018, the first edition's organizer [Jens](http://www.johl.io/), realized that it was a little too much work for him alone.
Enter Moritz, he liked [!!con](http://bangbangcon.com/) a lot when he was in NYC, and [found out](http://composition.al/blog/2017/03/31/scaling-bangbangcon/) about the Berlin equivalent.
Determined to revive it, he met with Jens, and told a few [Recursers](https://www.recurse.com/), of which [Joseph](http://dzol.github.io/), [Veit](http://veitheller.de/), and Nasreen reacted *enthusiastised* and joined the team. Then, after the 2018 edition, [blinry](https://morr.cc/) joined too.

The logo idea was born in a sketchbook at [Stratum 0's Malkr√§nzchen](https://stratum0.org/wiki/Malkr%C3%A4nzchen).
Brought to life by the spirited and talented Marina aka [mhmillustration](https://mhmillustration.myportfolio.com)!
We believe in [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), as it can be understood to be about programming and sharing in the broader sense.

The website is forked from [StarCon](https://github.com/StarConUW/) and inspired by !!con.
Read: On the shoulders of giants.

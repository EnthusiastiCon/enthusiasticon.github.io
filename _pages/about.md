## Who is who stories

EnthusiastiCon happened three times before. [2015](https://sourcecode.berlin/enthusiasticon/) it was brought to life. In 2018 the first edition's organizer [johl](http://www.johl.io/) realized that it was a little too much work for him alone.
Enter Moritz, he liked [!!con](http://bangbangcon.com/) a lot when he was in NYC, and [found out](http://composition.al/blog/2017/03/31/scaling-bangbangcon/) about the Berlin equivalent.
Determined to revive it, he met with johl, and told a few [Recursers](https://www.recurse.com/) and things were made happen.

The 2020 organizer team consists of blinry, Chris, Joseph, Moritz, Nandaja, Nasreen and Pieter.

The logo idea was born in a sketchbook at [Stratum 0's Malkr√§nzchen](https://stratum0.org/wiki/Malkr%C3%A4nzchen).
Brought to life by the spirited and talented Marina aka [mhmillustration](https://mhmillustration.myportfolio.com)!
We believe in [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), as it can be understood to be about programming and sharing in the broader sense.

The website is forked from [StarCon](https://github.com/StarConUW/) and inspired by !!con.

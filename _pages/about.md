## Who is who stories

EnthusiastiCon [happened before](https://sourcecode.berlin/enthusiasticon/), once, in 2015, but [Jens](http://www.johl.io/), the organizer, realized that it was a little too much work for him alone.
Enter Moritz, he liked [!!con](http://bangbangcon.com/) a lot when he was in NYC, and [found out](http://composition.al/blog/2017/03/31/scaling-bangbangcon/) about the Berlin equivalent.
Determined to revive it, he met with Jens, and told a few [Recursers](https://www.recurse.com/), of which [Joseph](http://dzol.github.io/) and [Veit](http://veitheller.de/) reacted *enthusiastised* and joined the team.

The logo idea was born in a sketchbook at [Stratum 0's Malkränzchen](https://stratum0.org/wiki/Malkr%C3%A4nzchen). Brought to life by the spirited and talented Marina aka [mhmillustration](https://mhmillustration.myportfolio.com)!
We believe in [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), as it is can be understood as about programming and sharing in the broader sense.

The website is forked from [StarCon](https://github.com/StarConUW/) and inspired by !!con.
